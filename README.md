## VSCODE IDE

- VSCODE Ready, all rules are setup for a great developing experience.

## Additional Tooling

- With-backend: `with-backend.js` Starts the ember app with a backend synchronously.
- Husky: checks linting + code duplication + integration & unit tests before commiting to VSC.

## Docker

- A docker image can be found in `images`.

## CI

A github workflow CI is provided.

## Approach

### Controllers

- We have the rule 'ember/no-controllers' activated, so usage of controllers other than for query params is prohibited. Instead, you must create a component in 'pages'. Each component should accept a @model.

Note: Exception for the ApplicationController, needed for an addon.

### Translations

Translations are located: `translations/`

- Each component must have his translation file
- A global translation file can be created
- YAML files keys in snake_case

### Changesets & Validations

Changesets are located: `app/changesets/`
Changesets services are located: `app/services/changesets`
Validations are located: `app/validations/`

- Each changeset has it's own file and it's own class.
- All changesets comes from `ember-immer-changeset`. It provides full type-checking of changesets.
- A changeset can have a service associated that persists the data of a changeset to an endpoint.

### Authorizations

Authorizations are located: `app/abilities/`.

### Components

Components are located: `app/components/`.

- Pod structure.

### API Mocking

Development mocks are in `app/handlers`.
Testing mocks are split in the `tests` folders.
